# laravel-visio-stencil
A stencil for quickly creating Laravel formatted database tables

# Install
1. Create a place to store your Visio stencils if it doesn't already exist (E.g. %userprofile%/Documents/My Shapes)
2. Copy "LaravelDatabaseStencil.vssx" to your "My Shapes" folder

# Load
1. Open a new or existing Visio document
2. Open shapes window if it isn't already open by going to View->Task Panes->Shapes
3. Select More Shapes->My Shapes->My Shapes->LaravelDatabaseStencil

# Creating Tables
Create new tables by dragging a "Table" shape onto the grid

# Creating Columns
Add different types of columns to the table by dragging the respective "Column" shape onto the table.  Alternatively, you can right click an existing column in the table to insert a new column of the same type above or below the existing column in the table.
Right click on a column to set a column as "Required" or not

# Removing Columns
Right click on a column and press the "Delete" key

# Creating Relationships
Drag a "Relationship" shape onto the grid.  Where you connect the ends of the Relationship shape is a matter of preference.   Personally, I like connect all Relationship tails to the bottom of the Table, and all of the heads to the top.

# The Template
The LaravelDatabaseTemplate.vsd file contains the migrations, password_resets & users tables as a starting point for a new Laravel database design
